## Features

To complete this challenge, I needed to add the following funcionalities to the app, and pass all tests.

* ``List dishes``: The ``Dashboard`` page should list all dishes from an API response.
* ``Add new dishes``: The button ``Add dish`` should open a form modal allowing the request for the creation of a new dish. After the confirmation, the dish list should reflect the changes.
* ``Edit a dish``: Each dish should have a button ``Edit`` that opens a form modal with current dish data and allow changes. After the edition confirmation, the dish list should reflect the changes.
* ``Remove a dish``: Each dish should have a button ``Delete`` that request the removal of the dish from the menu. After the removal confirmation, the dish list shoul reflect the changes.
* ``Update availability``: Each dish should have a button that toggles its availability.
